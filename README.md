# Airflow DAGs Setup and Scenarios  

This repository showcases a collection of **Apache Airflow DAGs** demonstrating various real-world scenarios, configurations, and best practices. It is designed to help data engineers and developers efficiently implement and manage workflows using Airflow.  

## Features  

- Modular and reusable DAGs for diverse scenarios.  
- Dynamic DAG generation using configuration files.  
- Examples of error handling, retries, and notifications.  
- Custom operators for specialized tasks.  

## Prerequisites  

- Python 3.7+  
- Apache Airflow 2.x+  
- Basic knowledge of Airflow concepts (DAGs, Tasks, Operators).  


## Example Scenarios

### ETL Pipeline

Extract, transform, and load data with retry mechanisms and task dependencies.
### API Integration

 Fetch data from external APIs with error handling and SLA monitoring.
### Dynamic DAGs

Generate DAGs dynamically from JSON/YAML configurations.


### Error Handling & Notifications

On-failure callbacks with email and Slack alerts.
